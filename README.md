# Apply-Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-to-a-Foundation-Model
<h4>Step - 1</h4>
Prepare the Foundation Model<br>
*Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance<br>
*Perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the pre-trained model<br>
*Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model<br><br>


<h4>Step - 2</h4>
Perform Lightweight Fine-Tuning<br>
*Create a PEFT model<br>
*Train the PEFT model<br>
*Save the PEFT model<br>
